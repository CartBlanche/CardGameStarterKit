# Card Game Starter Kit
This C# Starter Kit is a complete BlackJack card game. 

## History
The original code can be found here https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.CardGameStarterKit-VCS-3882 and dates back to 2010.
It was built using WinForms.

## Project Goals
Our goal is to update the original starter kit to work with modern GUI systems, so that anyone interested in creating a card game of sorts, can use this as a starting point. Over time the plan is to make this more modular, so game logic can be shared across GUIs and platforms, thus making porting easier.

## Versions
WinForms (inital check-in with VS2022 sln)
MAUI
MonoGame
(other)
